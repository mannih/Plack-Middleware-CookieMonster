NAME
       Plack::Middleware::CookieMonster - Eats all your (session) cookies
       in case Plack::Middleware::StrackTrace ate your HTTP headers.

SYNOPSIS
        # Only expire selected cookies
        enable 'CookieMonster', cookies_names => [ 'session_cookie', 'foobar_cookie' ];
        enable 'StackTrace';


        # Expire all cookies the browser sent
        enable 'CookieMonster';
        enable 'StackTrace';

DESCRIPTION
       When developing a plack application with Plack::Middleware::StackTrace
       enabled, you may sometimes find yourself in a situation where your
       current session for your webapp is borked. Your app would usually clear
       any session cookies in that case, but since
       Plack::Middleware::StackTrace will simply throw away any HTTP headers
       you set, you'll be stuck to that session.

       Plack::Middleware::CookieMonster will detect that
       Plack::Middleware::StackTrace rendered a stack trace and will add
       Set-Cookie headers to the response so that the cookies you configured
       or all cookies that the browser sent will be expired.

       This middleware was written because I was too lazy to search the "clear
       cookies" control in my browser and because I think we should automate as
       much as possible.

CONFIGURATION
       You can provide a "cookie_names" parameter, pointing to an array-ref
       containing the names of all the cookies you want to clear. Otherwise,
       all cookies the browser sent will be expired.
